\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage{listings}
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  \usepackage{url}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
\section{Methodolody}
\subsection{Research Goals}

This research is aimed at answering the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1}. What impact does usage examples have on REST API client developer productivity?
  \item \textbf{RQ2}. What problems API client developers face when using a REST API documentation that lacks usage examples?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements} % (fold)

To answer the aforementioned research questions, the study has the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{R1. Realistic.} We had to choose an existing REST API that is currently used by API client developers. Selecting a mature REST API for this study reduces the possibility of an underdeveloped solution that may be found if a new or a seldom used API is selected. A familiar domain needed to be selected so that participants are able to relate to the API features without requiring upfront training. In addition to selecting the API, we had to select tasks that are related to the core features provided by the API to represent reality.
  \item \textbf{Open source.} To be able to understand the impact of usage examples, we needed to select an open-source API where we can add new examples to the documentation for performing this study. For proprietary APIs, it won't be possible to retrofit usage examples on existing API documentation without separating the examples from the documentation.
  \item \textbf{R2. Time bound.} The total time spent by each participant is required to be time bound to measure productivity. As a result, the study needs to be setup such that participants are able to focus on performing the tasks minimizing any overhead.
  \item \textbf{R3. Experienced developers.} Developers with prior experience on REST APIs need to be recruited as study participants to perform the study within a limited amount of time and in a realistic setup. Furthermore, to reduce a learning bias, only participants with no prior experince of using the WordPress REST API V2 are accepted for this study.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Study Object} % (fold)

We selected the WordPress REST API V2 for this study. WordPress is a blog-like open-source (R2) framework used by over 409 million people to visit 23.6 billion pages each month. The API allows programmatic access to list, create, update, and delete WordPress data such as blog posts, comments, users, images, tags, etc.

The WordPress REST API V2 has been published and maintained since May 2015. Before January 2017, the WordPress REST API V2 was distributed as a plug-in where WordPress users could optionally install the API component. The following statistics are for the plug-in install numbers between May 2015 and October 2016:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Total installs: aprox. 248K installs of the plug-in.
  \item Average daily installs: approx. 500.
\end{itemize}

Starting January 2017, the WordPress REST API V2 is no longer required to be installed as a separate plug-in since it's pre-bundled with every WordPress install. As per the code repository on GitHub, there are a total of 99 and 46 contributors that had at least one commit to the code repository behind the API and and it's documentation, respectively. These properties satisfy R1, our requirements for being realistic.

By selecting an open-source project we are able to access the source-code to inspect the implementation and documentation technique of the WordPress REST API. The API implements a self-documenting feature where API developers expose API endpoints over HTTP OPTIONS verb to explain the API elements. To implement this feature, the API developers describe the API elements in the code. For example:


\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=php,breaklines=true,showspaces=false,showstringspaces=false,numbers=left,xleftmargin=2em,caption={Example of self-documenting API Code},label=wordpress_code]
public function get_item_schema() {
  $schema = array(
    '$schema'    => 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#',
    'title'      => $this->post_type,
    'type'       => 'object',
    /*
     * Base properties for every Post.
     */
    'properties' => array(
        'date'            => array(
            'description' => __( "The date the object was published, in the site's timezone." ),
            'type'        => 'string',
            'format'      => 'date-time',
            'context'     => array( 'view', 'edit', 'embed' ),
        ),...
\end{lstlisting}

On Listing \ref{wordpress_code}, line 4 specifies that this is a schema definition for the API element $Post$. Then, on Line 10, it defines $date$, one of the properties of $Post$, followed by a human readable description and and type information. Then, on line 14, the context of this property is mentioned as $view, edit, embed$, meaning that this property will be returned when the $Post$ object is returned, embedded, or can be used as an input for editing.

This self-documenting feature is leveraged to generate and publish the official API documentation as an HTML website. Figure \ref{fig:schema} shows a screenshot of the published documentation for the $date$ attribute of the $Post$ API element\footnote{\url{http://v2.wp-api.org/reference/posts/}}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{schema.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Screenshot showing auto-generated documentation for Post/date}
\label{fig:schema}
\end{figure}

In addition to the auto-generated documentation of the the schema and API actions, custom content is added by the contributors to the API documentation project to provide prosaic overviews and usage examples.
