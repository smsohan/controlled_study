## P2.1

`CODE: API  bug`
`CODE: Examples were good`
`CODE: Doc insufficent for exceptions`

1. **Rating**: 8 / 10
2. **Feedback**: I did this on my iPhone, which is not a common platform for interacting with APIs. :)

However the experience was quite good, but the design could be more responsive for mobile devices. Also, I received an error when trying to update the post excerpt. The documentation did not provide helpful information on what the error might mean, and it didn't show require parameters, etc. without this I found it difficult to move past the 401 error I was receiving.

## P2.10

`CODE: Example were good`
`CODE: Suggests swagger, in-place API call`

1. **Rating**: 7 / 10
2. **Feedback**: The curl example was good to know how exactly to call the APIs. The schema was well defined to know what to expect from the response and request params. As you have a schema definition for request and response, it would be great to support API calls using that schema as http://swagger.io do. I personally like swagger, because it defines the schema and also let you call APIs through the documentation using that schema, and also translate the request that you did to curl.

## P2.2


`CODE: API design issue author vs. user`
`CODE: API doc doesn't explicitly mentions total header`


1. **Rating**: 8 / 10
2. **Feedback**: In case of search posts by author, it's not clear how to find the author_id. Although I realized that users and authors are same in this case. In large application such mapping might not be possible in case of other types of resources.

The documentation also didn't clarify that I can get total post count from the response header. This might give new programmers hard time.

## P2.3


1. **Rating**: 8 / 10
2. **Feedback**: This api is well documented and provides resources that are easy to discover. Also standard use of headers and http verbs.

## P2.4

2. **Feedback**:

## P2.5

`CODE: Good examples`
`CODE: API design issue: PUT vs. POST for update`

1. **Rating**: 7 / 10
2. **Feedback**: My rating of work with WP API is this, because some of the tasks were easily done with API but some not.

API looks little bit outdated in compare to current SotA (like update of post with POST). Also, some tasks are not easily doable with this API (number of posts).

Documentation  looks good, I like examples next to description of properties.


## P2.6

`CODE: Good examples`


1. **Rating**: 7 / 10
2. **Feedback**: I think posting a blog entry is a pretty straightforward task anyways (I blog and have used other blogging platforms). The overall documentation was quite sparse but because I knew a bit about the scene I could figure out what keywords to look for.  the examples are great. I have a hard time using any API without seeing that.

## P2.7

`CODE: Create/update was straight-forward`
`CODE: False negative: Doc contained examples of multiple exclude`

1. **Rating**: 7 / 10
2. **Feedback**: It wasn't horrible. Creating and updating posts was straight forward.
It seems like the number of posts can be retrieved from the HEAD, but I am still not certain of it. In any case, I did not find the answer from the documentation, and began to experiment with requests.
When excluding posts, I did not find how to enter multiple ids from the documentation.

## P2.8

1. **Rating**: 8 / 10
2. **Feedback**: It's average.

## P2.9

`CODE: Examples are good`

1. **Rating**: 9 / 10
2. **Feedback**: documentation is written quite nicely with the examples which are easy to understand.
