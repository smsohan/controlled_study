Paper outline

Analysis
  Coding vs. counting
  
  Quotes -> link to the problems
  
  Raw data
    Participant info (expe, feed, rating)
      report the experience -> participant selection
  participant      p1 p2 
  industry         5  8

    for each task
      for each trial attempt
        4 inputs, output -> verdict (Success / Failure)
    
    comparison between two groups
      success rate
      number of failed trials
      experience rating

Results
  Developers had problem using API request URL with right data type
    Implication: API documentation should include it.
    Examples of the observation -> link

  Developers had problem using API request URL with arrays
  Developers had problem using API response header info
  Developers had problem using API request headers
  Developers had problem using API request body 


Coding
  open coding, no starter set
  Applying codes to describe an error in the participant input
  Group the errors under higher level themes
  Reach results

  Inter-rater reliability ->  get the raw data, code it, and share with Craig and Frank
